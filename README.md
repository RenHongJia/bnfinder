# bnfinder
BNFinder - tool for learning bayesian networks.

It can be used for both dynamic and static networks. It is written in python (requires version > 2.4, python 3 is not supported yet, but we plan to do it soon), and distributed under GNU GPL Library version 2.

The installation is performed by a single command in the source directory (it may require the administrator privileges):

`python setup.py install`

During the installation it will automaticaly setup fpconst and scipy python packages if needed. Also you can run it without installing:

`python bnf --help`
